							How it all started
						</h2>
						<p id="" class="">It all started when I realised I needed something to help me retain what I had memorised thus far. Hence, the birth of this web application. It would receive my own typed out notes and parse it in a way it understand, and I would be able to create tests based on the chapters/individual question. It did help me tremendously on memorising content, especially for Geography (I managed to score full marks for the essay portion!).</p>
						<p id="" class="">I had spent roughly 3 consecutive weeks building up this application, with the last 2 weeks  mainly spent on polishing up features, getting rid of bugs and what not. Though I did think I invested too much of my time into the creation instead of actually studying, so that's the downside of this project.</p>
						<p id="" class="">However, with the multitude of features built into it, such as a study page where it displays all the content, formarted in cards or the highlighter feature where it highlights pre-defined keywords to better isolate the important parts. I think the trade-off was well worth it. Especially with the national examinations, really anticipating it to shine its light for it.</p>
						<p id="" class="">Really focused on the visual aspect and I do think I did a great job. The cards in the study page are colour-coded based on their corresponding chapter to be able to better differentiate them. Not only that, at the end of a test (a finished test), it will display the entire questions alongside with the correct answer and the individual grading you got (though grades are displayed immediately after finishing a question). It isn't only the visual aspect which received most of my attention, the application is able to store 7 of the latest tests, in order, allowing you to do multiple tests at once or come back to it later, leaving at where u left off. Viewing a completed tests will show the summary as mentioned.</p>

							Notes
						</h2>
						<p id="" class="">I chose Google Documents as my choice of editor for notes as I can easily access it both from my Personal Learning Device (PLD, the awesome device MOE gave to all Secondary school students) and my phone, which made it really portable. I often found myself reading up on my notes whilst commuting to and fro school, which would otherwise had been a waste of time.</p>
						<p id="" class="">Following a rather simple syntax,</p>
						<p id="" class=""><code>[Chapter Name]</code> a root chapter</p>
						<p id="" class=""><code>[--Chapter Name]</code> a descendant chapter of a root chapter, must have a parent before</p>
						<p id="" class=""><code>!Word1:</code> defines a new question, any content followed directly will be the 'answer'</p>
						<p id="" class=""><code>keywords: keyword1</code> defines the keyword section, any text following directly after (ignoring whitespace, with a non-escaped comma as the delimiter) is regarded as the keywords for the question; also acts the closing statement for the word, any paragraph content after is ignored (actual keyword can use regular expression's assertions if toggled true on preferences, else parser would automatically escape the regex assertions)</p>
						<p id="" class=""><code>===</code> denote the start/close of a comment; comments must be closed</p>
						<div class="content-container left-right" id="">
							<div class="" id="">
								<h4 id="" class="">
									Notes
								</h4>
								<ul id="" class="">
									<li id="" class="">Annotate your notes however you want, it will not affect the parsed content</li>
									<li id="" class="">Add sections of content not directly related to the actual content in comments block denoted by '==='</li>

							A little bit more into the technicalities
						</h2>
						<p id="" class="">Backend is written in Javascript with <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJs</a> with the <a href="https://expressjs.com">express</a> module and a few other modules such as <code>express-session</code> for session handling.</p>
						<p id="" class="">Database is a very simple <code>.json</code> file since I was looking for a non-relational database and I had no other experience with other NoSQL databases. (also didn't want to spend majority of the time working out a minor aspect)</p>
						<p id="" class="">Data is given a hierarchy system, with each chapter establishing a parent-children-sibling relationship with adajacent chapters. This helped organise the topics and set the baseline for interacting with the data, such as when creating tests or presets.</p>

					<p id="" class="">As an avid watcher of shows, especially anime, I often found myself losing track of what episodes I was on. Online databases such as AnimePlanet (AP) and MyAnimeList (MAL) were my fix-all solutions to my issues.</p>
