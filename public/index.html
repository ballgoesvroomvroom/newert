				<h1>Full stack web application</h1>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>A studying application to help with self-revision.</p>
				<p>Made with <a href=NodeJs>NodeJs</a> with the <a href=express>express</a> module doing the heavy-lifting for the server-side, client-side is purely HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
				<p>Didn't go with any software stack since I am not too well-versed in it, though the application is packed with a lot of features which I found it to be very useful.</p>

					<h2>How it came about</h2>
					<p>The first thought of wanting to memorise definitions was what really struck the inspiration for this project. I had not known it was so similar to the "flashcard" method of studying until I read up on studying techniques and was also when I learnt more about different studying methods such as the most common one, spaced reptition. Though it is slightly different, it takes in user input and returns an automatically graded score based on set definitions and keywords.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Data input</h2>
					<p>The data (words and definitions) are all exported from Google Documents as a <code>.txt</code> file. The sole reason was because Google Documents is really accessible, both from the phone and computer. This makes it so that the notes I typed out can be used whenever and anywhere I want. On addition, being able to share the notes with friends and classmates is also one benefit I found. Not only that, I can annotate as and however I like such as highlight or setting font sizes and weights on Google Documents and still have it usable by my custom parser as these kind of data are not exported when downloading the document as a text file.</p>
					<a href=image of notes in google documents>.png</a>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>The notes itself can contain a hierarchy system where a sub chapter (denoted by a/multiple hyphen '-' at the start of the chapter name) can be a direct children of another chapter defined directly above it, building a tree along the way.</p>
					<p>Since the data is stored "recursively" to maintain parent-child relationships, there should be a limit on how far the indents can go. Creating "deep descendants" of a root chapter is possible but is not advised.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Keywords (defined by a "keywords: " header on a new line) contains the user-defined keywords. Regular expressions can be used (if toggled true via preferences; default: <code>true</code>) in the keywords itself to match for multiple variants of the same word, such as different word form or tense. Keywords are always wrapped in word boundary '\b' to search for occurrence.</p>
					<p>Though there are some characters that need to escaped if the literal form is to be used, such as assertion characters for regular expression. This can be ignored if preferences disabled regular expressions matching, the server will escape it for you.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Self-testing</h2>
					<p>The main feature of this was to test the user on the definitions of the words.</p>
					<p>It grades the answer using regular expressions to match for user-defined keywords, with the total matched keywords against the total keywords count.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Syntax for notes (input)</h3>
					<pre><code>[Chapter Name]

!Elephant:
Giant four-legged animal
keywords: giant, four, animal

!Horse:
Powerful four-legged animal
keywords: powerful, four, animal</code></pre>
					<p>- Chapter header are matched with <code>/(?&amp;lt;!\\)^\[(.+)\]\s*$/g</code>.</p>
					<p>- If an opening square bracket is to be used at the start of a new line, either add a space padding before the opening square bracket or escape it with <code>\</code>. Or even added non-whitespace characters after the closing square bracket</p>
					<p>- There can be trailing whitespace after the closing square bracket but no other characters.</p>
					<p>- If <code>Chapter Name</code> is a sub chapter of a root chapter, we can give it an indent by adding one hyphen at the start. E.g. <code>[-Chapter Name]</code>; descendants of a root chapter can be added but there has to be a direct parent. E.g. a <code>[---Chapter Name]</code> must have either a chapter with 3 indent or higher or a 2 indent chapter above it.</p>
					<p>- Hyphens are captured using <code>/^-+ ?/g</code> on the actual chapter name (without the square brackets).</p>
					<p>- Only one space between the hypen and the name is allowed. Chapter name will be as is, discarding the addition space after the hyphen (if present).</p>
					<p>- To include actual hyphens in the name itself, add a/multiple space(s) right after the opening bracket and right before the first hyphen itself.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Database</h2>
					<p>Chose a simple approach to storing data by using <code>.json</code> files. Relational databases was not really appropriate and I had no other experience with other NoSQL databases, and with the time constraint, I didn't want to spend too long on a minor aspect of the entire application.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Special features</h2>
					<p>Aesthetic appeals, highlighter of a light tone to mark out marked keywords within content answer (the definition).</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Study along, a <code>/study</code> path to display all notes along with their keywords. Contents are also highlighted accordingly based on keywords.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Ability to store the history of 7 tests. Allowing you to view the past 7 tests.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Come back where you left off, the tests save progress on a per question basis.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Able to view the summary of all questions of a completed test, displayed alongside with the content's answer.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Front-end is mobile friendly too, maximising all space on the narrow screen.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Irrelevant data can be added to the notes file as comments, denoted by adding three consecutive keywords and NOTHING else (not even any whitespace on the same line). Sandwich the multi-line comment by <code>===</code>; similar to Python's multi-line comments but instead of quotes, it uses equal signs.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Create presets which can contains a mixed collection of chapters/words to test yourself again easily. This helps with the spaced repetition method. Presets can contain a single word from a chapter and a whole other chapter, it's really a freeflow thing.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Negated keywords, denoted by a tilde at the start, can be used to accurately highlight the contents. If a word occurs before the actual word you want to highlight, you can use the negated keyword to skip over ONE iteration of the word. Use multiple negated keywords if there are multiple occurrences you want to skip.</p>
					<p>E.g.</p>
					<pre><code>The fast donkey jumped over the fast-moving fox.
keywords: ~fast, fast</code></pre>
					<p>In this case, the second occurrence of 'fast' (in 'fast-moving') will be highlighted since a hyphen character is also considered as a word boundary :).</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Caveats</h2>
					<p>If regular expressions is toggled true, malformed keywords contained illegal regular expressions will error on the server-side (not handled, yikes), returning a 400 error to the client. Making it really hard to "debug" which part of the notes went wrong especially if the note file is really large.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Unable to edit chapter name or remove any chapter or words (<code>/edit</code> page is work in progress);</p>
					<p>Though a <code>/api/words/modify</code> endpoint exists on the server, working on a <code>PATCH</code> request.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Weak server validation. Early stage of development was intended for my own use only, hence did not heavily enforce data validation on server side, especially checking for data format, though client side does vet and parse the data accordingly (all errors and malformed inputs are handled there). Though there is still the possibility of sending malformed raw data directly to the server using a POST request.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Bad navigation. There is a lack of navigation buttons, the main means of navigation is via changing the url path directly in the browser; with the root being <code>\</code>.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>Compatibility between browsers; application was tested only in a Chrome browswer, an unintentional bug may occur if another browser is used.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Closing note</h2>
					<p>As mentioned, this was really intended to help me with my examinations and hence the user experience,  server-side security and architecture may be a little flawed.</p>
					<p>Still, this can easily be one of my proudest work that I poured 100% of my effort into. [emoji]</p>

					<h2>TO WORK ON</h2>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>CORRECTLY DISPLAY TEST CONTENTS in history</p>
					<p>DISPLAY USERNAME on frontend (that's the minimal you can do; add a user popup panel to logout even)</p>
